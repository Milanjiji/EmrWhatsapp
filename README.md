### EmrWhatsApp

A chatapp based on sms

### Why

mostly privacy - when a sms is send it will be deleted completly after some time when the other user gets the message , and that is that reason , like other chatapp based on servers 
it stores it in the database but not get deleted. 

for example - Otp service is based on sms 

# How 

andorid app is in the release
download on the sender and reciver device
chat...

## Limitation

My intention was to just create a logic , not to make the app look cooler on the outside - so excpect bugs and less fuctionality than other apps
